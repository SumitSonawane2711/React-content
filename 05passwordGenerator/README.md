# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

till understand :

useCallback : memorised the overall function or part of the function. the values which are memorised by the hook depneds on dependencies privide in the defination.

useEffect : this called first when the page is reload. it rerun whenever any dependencies changed.

to copy text in the clipboard we used, window.navigator.clipboard.writeText(pass); method

useRef : used to pass the reference to variable
